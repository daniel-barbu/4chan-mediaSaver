# 4chan-mediaSaver
4chan-mediaSaver is a Javascipt tool that allows you to save all medias' (videos, photos, etc.) links from a 4chan thread.  
You can then use the links list to download the media using [Tab Save](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-save/lkngoeaeclaebmpkgapchgjdbaekacki).

### How to use
1. The overlay is made for 4chan threads, so make sure you are on one.
2. Open [`script.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniel-barbu/4chan-mediaSaver/main/script.js) and copy-paste the code to the console of the previously opened webpage.

### Known Issues
1. You have to copy-paste the code to the console eveytime you want to play.  t
   It might be possible to use an extension/add-on like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)/[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) to automate this process.
